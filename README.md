Suppose you are going on holiday. Your navigation app shows you a geo-map with your hotel
and you want to see photos that are near this place.

In your navigation app

* (1) select a place in the map (i.e. your hotel)
* (2) open menu "view in external app" (or "send location to" or "share location with" or ...)
* (3) choose "üåçüì∑ Photos Nearby" as destination 
* (4) => The webbrowser opens with a web page with photos near the selected place.

Technically speaking the app

* hooks into the android system for view/send/share events for geographic coordinates (also known as [geo: - uri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo_URI_scheme)),
* Translates the geo data into SPARQL database query
* converts the query into a https web adress
* and asks android to show the web adress in a webbrowser
