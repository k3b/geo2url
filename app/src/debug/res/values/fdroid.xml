This app adds the option *🌍📷 Photos Nearby* to any app that can shown/send/share a geo location or **geo-uri** .

This app hooks into the android system to intercept "view geo-uri". When getting a geo-uri it
puts the geo-location into a databasequery and asks www.wikidata.org to display the result in a web browser.

Note: The app has no userinterface of it-s own.

Note: You can use [the commons app](https://f-droid.org/packages/fr.free.nrw.commons/) to
upload photos to commons.wikimedia.org.

Here are some f-droid apps that are compatible with *🌍📷 Photos Nearby*

* navigation: [OsmAnd](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.osmand.plus/),
* public transportation: [Transportr](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.grobox.liberario) or [oeffi](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.schildbach.oeffi)
